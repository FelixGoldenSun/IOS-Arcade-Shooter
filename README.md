# IOS-Arcade-Shooter

This is a simple gradius like game I made for IOS in Swift 2. It is not in any way complete, in fact it is barley functional. You can shoot stuff however, there is a score. You can even get shot at, which is the best thing I have ever done in swift. It was for a class, and I only had access to a Mac at the school. Also, the class was only four weeks long, so I am still proud of it.
